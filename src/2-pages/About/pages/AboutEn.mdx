# 👋 Hello!

Zerro is an unofficial app for [Zenmoney](https://zenmoney.app/), it helps to plan your finances correctly.

<ExampleBox symbol="🖤">
  <p>
    Zerro is a free application, but you can always
    [buy me a coffee](/donation).

</ExampleBox>

<Box
  component="img"
  src={wholeImg}
  alt="This is roughly what the interface looks like"
  sx={{
    maxWidth: '100%',
    borderRadius: 1,
    border: '1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.08)',
    boxShadow: '0 8px 32px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.16)',
  }}
/>

## What's inside?

### Budgets

The main advantage of Zerro is envelope-type budgets. If you've used YNAB, you know how cool this is. Read about the budgeting approach to get a better understanding.

- [Budgeting Approach in Zerro](/about/method)
- [Getting Started](/about/quick-start)

### Fixing Corrections

Sometimes after syncing with the bank, duplicate transactions appear, to catch them:

1. Open the duplicate transaction
2. Click "Others from this sync" at the bottom
3. Now you can view these transactions and delete them if necessary

### And more...

- Restoring deleted transactions
- Dark mode 🌚
- Group actions with transactions: changing categories and deletion.
- Full backup of all data (without restoration yet)

## How to install the app?

Zerro is a web application. It's as cool as regular apps (can even work offline), and is installed directly from the browser ✨

- **iPhone.** In Safari "Share" → "Add to Home Screen"
- **Android.** In Chrome three dots in the top right corner → "Install app"
- **Windows / MacOS.** In Chrome icon in the address bar "Install app"

## A few words about security

<ExampleBox symbol="🔒">
  <p>
    Zerro does not have access to your banking connections. Zenmoney stores these data
    in your app and does not transmit through API, third-party services simply do not have
    access to them.
  </p>
  [API Documentation](https://github.com/zenmoney/ZenPlugins/wiki/ZenMoney-API)
</ExampleBox>

- Zerro does not store anything on its own. Data is stored locally on your computer and in Zenmoney.
- Source code is open and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ardov/zerro).
- Zerro collects only anonymous statistics like the number of visits, these numbers warm my heart and help solve problems 🙂
