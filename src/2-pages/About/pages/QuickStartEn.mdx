# Getting Started

## 1. Setting Up Accounts

First, let's determine which money we will be categorizing. There are two groups of accounts:

- **Accounts in the balance.** These are the funds we will be working with and distributing across categories.
- **Accounts outside the balance.** These accounts are not included in the budget and do not affect it. Include all debt accounts here: loans, mortgages. Also, money that we do not want to distribute by categories, for example, investment accounts.

You can turn an account on or off from the balance directly in Zerro by double-clicking on it.

<DetailsBox title="What to do with credit cards?">
  Credit cards can be used in different ways, so they can fall into either group. How do you use your credit card?

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>I don’t use the credit card, only pay off the debt.</strong> Then you can consider it a loan and keep it outside the balance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>I use the credit card and always have money to pay off the debt on it.</strong>
      In this case, you can safely include the credit card in the balance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>I use the credit card and have a large debt on it.</strong> Unfortunately,
      Zerro doesn't have a neat solution for this situation yet. But you can use
      a couple of tricks.
    </li>
  </ul>
</DetailsBox>

## 2. Allocating Money

Hurray, we are ready to allocate money! Open the current month and look at the "Unallocated" figure - that's exactly how much money needs to be distributed across categories (envelopes). If any category is missing, create it in Zenmoney .

<Box
  component="img"
  src={wholeImg}
  alt="This is roughly what the interface looks like"
  sx={{
    my: 4,
    maxWidth: '100%',
    borderRadius: 1,
    border: '1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.08)',
    boxShadow: '0 8px 32px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.16)',
  }}
/>

### How to Save?

And how would we save with paper envelopes? We would create a separate envelope for each goal: vacation, car, new phone, etc. Work with Zerro in the same way. Create the necessary category and regularly set aside money there.

<DetailsBox title="How to hide a category in Zenmoney , but keep it in Zerro?">
  <ol>
    <li> Create a category and check “Show in expenses”</li>
    <li> Assign a budget to it</li>
    <li> Uncheck “Show in expenses”</li>
  </ol>
  Now the category won't appear in Zenmoney 's expense categories but will be visible in Zerro,
  because there is money in this “envelope”.
</DetailsBox>

### How to Account for Transfers?

All transfers outside the balance take money out of the budget. For example, transfers to a mortgage or investment account. Such transfers should be planned in advance, and Zerro can do this.

Zerro automatically creates categories for all accounts outside the balance. These categories will appear as soon as you make a transfer.

For example, every month we pay 1000₽ on a loan, for this we transfer money to a special “Loan” account outside the balance. How to account for this transfer?

1. Find the "Loan" category in the list and set aside 1000₽ there. This reserves money for the transfer. If the category is not visible, enable its display in the table settings.
2. When we transfer 1000₽ to the loan, the transfer will be recorded as an expense in the category.

## 4. Monitor the Budget

- After each paycheck, go to Zerro and distribute unallocated money across categories.
- Periodically check that there is enough money in the categories. You can [install Zerro as an app](https://t.me/zerroapp/10) for this.
- Move money from one category to another if needed. You can directly drag them from the “Available” column.
- Save and [create new goals](https://t.me/zerroapp/7).
- Subscribe to the [updates channel](https://t.me/zerroapp) and ask questions in the [chat](https://t.me/zerrochat).
