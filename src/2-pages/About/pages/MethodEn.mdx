# Approach to Budgets

Let's understand the principles of budgeting one should adhere to and why.

## Paper Envelopes

One of the simplest and most popular ways to manage money is paper envelopes. It's straightforward:

- Make a paper envelope for each spending category and label it: "Groceries", "Car", "Vacation", "Rainy Day", etc.
- Distribute all the money across these envelopes.
- Use money from the respective envelope for purchases. For example, pay for bread at the store from the "Groceries" envelope.
- When there's not enough money in an envelope, either take money from another one or forego the purchase.

With paper envelopes, you always know what you have money for and decide for yourself what to sacrifice if you've spent too much.

Unfortunately, paper envelopes are somewhat outdated – they only work with cash and require too much effort to maintain order. I doubt anyone is ready to give up bank cards and deposits now.

  <b>Envelopes + Banks</b>
  <br />
  For a couple of years, I tried to integrate the envelope method with banks. I created ~10 accounts for different spending categories and used them as envelopes. It involved constantly transferring money from one account to another, and now I'm convinced there is a more elegant solution.

## Evolution of Envelopes

Imagine envelopes you don't have to carry around: the balance of each envelope is visible in the app, and spent money is automatically deducted from the right one. Zerro turns your categories from Zen-money into such envelopes:

- **Budget** - the amount added or removed from the envelope this month.
- **Expense** - money spent from the envelope.
- **Balance** - the amount of money in the envelope.
- **Unallocated** - money outside of envelopes that still needs to be allocated. If the number is negative, it means you've allocated more than you have and need to take from somewhere.

## What is YNAB?

YNAB is the acronym for the popular budgeting system [You Need A Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (EN: you need a budget). Essentially, YNAB takes the same envelopes and adds a few rules to them. Below is my interpretation of these rules, and the original can be read on the [YNAB website](https://www.youneedabudget.com/the-four-rules/).

### Rule № 1. Every Ruble Must Have a Purpose

If money is all in one pile, we never know for sure what we have enough money for and what we don’t. We see a large sum and think we have enough for anything - so why not buy that cute trinket?

To avoid illusions, it's important to distribute all the money across envelopes. Now, before buying something, look in the corresponding envelope: is there enough money there?

<ExampleBox symbol="❌">
  <b>All Money in One Pile</b>
  <br />
  The card has 50,000₽, and we think there’s still a lot of money, so why not go to an expensive restaurant. Only later do we remember that we forgot to pay for the apartment and repay a friend's debt. In the end, we run out of money and go into debt again.
</ExampleBox>

<ExampleBox symbol="✅">
  <b>Money Distributed in Envelopes</b>
  <br />
  Instead of looking at the card balance, we check the “Restaurants” envelope. There’s only 600₽ left. Seems like we need to postpone the outing or choose a cheaper place - but at least we're sure other expenses are under control.
</ExampleBox>

### Rule № 2. Prepare for Expenses in Advance

Most expenses can be predicted. Usually, we remember monthly expenses like rent and internet, but completely forget about less regular ones: car insurance, Christmas gifts, etc.

If changing to winter tires or buying Christmas gifts hits your budget hard, this rule is for you.

<ExampleBox symbol="❌">
  <b>Budget Doesn’t Account for Large Expenses</b>
  <br />
  All year we pretend New Year's doesn't exist. In December, we realize the holiday is indeed happening and spend a large amount on gifts. The budget bursts at the seams, and we go into debt.
</ExampleBox>

<ExampleBox symbol="✅">
  <b>Preparing for Holidays Throughout the Year</b>
  <br />
  We know we spend about 18,000₽ on Christmas gifts each year. We create an envelope for gifts and put 1,500₽ in it every month. Now we don’t have to worry about gifts, and there’s no shock to the budget.
</ExampleBox>

### Rule № 3. Plans Change, and That’s Okay

A budget is not a vow. Spent more than planned? Okay, just adjust the budget. There's nothing wrong with moving money from one envelope to another, the main thing is to understand the consequences of this choice. Of course, it’s not wise to take money set aside for rent to buy a new iPhone. But if you're willing to sacrifice a vacation for an iPhone - then why not?

### Rule № 4. Live on Last Month’s Salary

The idea is to stop living paycheck to paycheck. When income arrives, we set it aside for the next month, and this month we spend money saved from the previous one.

With this approach, we no longer have to say, "let's wait until after payday," or delay paying bills due to a lack of funds. We always have enough money to immediately pay bills and forget about them.

Yes, this implies that we have a financial cushion the size of one month's income. And yes, it won't happen overnight, but it’s worth striving for.
